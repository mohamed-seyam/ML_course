## task 1 

# Requirements:
You are supposed to apply a model to classify mnist dataset.
1. Apply a binary model (already implemented models in scikit learn) that can classify one digit, say 3 and determine if this digit is 3 or not.
2. Get the confusion matrix.
3. Using the binary classifier you already used to classify the 10 digits (multiclass classification).
# You are required to write a report that includes:
I. Show 5 examples from the used mnist dataset.
II. The findings of the previous requirements.
III. Interpret the output of the confusion matrix you get from requirement 2.
